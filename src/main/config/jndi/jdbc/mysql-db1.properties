# Connection pool configuration (optional)
#
# - initialSize: the initial number of connections that are created when the pool is started
# - maxTotal: the maximum number of active connections that can be allocated from this pool at the same time, 
#             or negative for no limit
# - maxIdle: the maximum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool, without extra ones being released, 
#            or negative for no limit.
# - minIdle: the minimum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool, without extra ones being created, 
#            or zero to create none
# - maxWaitMillis: the maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there are no available connections)
#                  for a connection to be returned before throwing an exception, or -1 to wait indefinitely.
#
# At least, you must configure the 'initialSize' property to use a connection pool. If this property is not present, 
# a connection pool will not be available.
